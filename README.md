# Dataflow-HLS

I've been playing around with [dataflow-ish-ideas](http://github.com/bollu/dataflow)
for a while now, so I thought I might as well write a small chip-like-thing that runs
dataflow stuff.

For now, I'll be using the repo to get basic things up and running. This includes:
- [ ] How to interface with RAM.
- [ ] How to use the block design integrator correctly to setup stuff.
- [ ] Scripting `Tcl` so I can avoid using Vivado HLS entirely.
- [ ] Running some simple benchmarks.


This is done as part of my course curricula, for the complex digital system
design course.
